Little details:
You cannot click the close button on the keybinds frame.
While keybinding, you cannot interact with the game.
Therefore, until you click confirm, you will not be able to interact with the game.
This is an intended feature.

The only keybinds that work are single character keybinds
Space does work if you leave it empty, if you try to use other keys such as shift and enter, the keybind will stay the same.

You can only fit one character into a keybind. Try typing more :)

Keybinds are case sensitive

Esc pulls open the settings menu
