Little details:
You cannot click the close button on the keybinds frame.
While keybinding, you cannot interact with the game.
Therefore, until you click confirm, you will not be able to interact with the game.
This is an intended feature.

The only keybinds that work are single character keybinds
Space does work if you leave it empty, if you try to use other keys such as shift and enter, the keybind will stay the same.

You can only fit one character into a keybind. Try typing more :)

Keybinds are case sensitive

Esc pulls open the settings menu

r resets to beginning of current level

HowToPlay shows the default (and recommended) keybinds.
They do not display customly changed keybinds.
The updated keybinds can be viewed in settings -> key binds

Hitting back on the settings screen (when in the middle of a game) will resume the previous position
Changing the screen to menu however, resets the level.

Clicking none of the blocks sets the block to "eraser"
Re-clicking a block with the same block will remove the block
